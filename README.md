Just a bunch of scripts that'll help make things easier..

For the best and fastest use, inside the directory where the login.py file is, create a .txt file named "credentials.txt" (no quotes).
In the first line type your username (case sensitive).
In the second line type your password.
In the third line type your ID.
In the fourth line type your preferred browser of use (Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox).
When finished, save your file and run the login.py file.

If creating a text file isn't your cup of tea, when you run the python file in the first time, make sure to type all the necessary arguments.
An example for a valid first run:
python3 login.py --username YOUR_USERNAME --password YOUR_PASSWORD --id YOUR_ID --browser chrome/safari/firefox/edge

That's it, hope it'll help!
